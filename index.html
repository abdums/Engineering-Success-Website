        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This project examines the Panama Canal as a historic engineering
          success. The study traces the root causes behind the Canal’s eventual
          success after a period of difficulty and failed attempts, identifies
          the engineering and technology sub-disciplines involved, describes
          cultural drivers, evaluates innovations, and maps the teamwork and
          leadership practices that enabled completion.

          <h3>Who</h3>
          <p>
            The Panama Canal’s successful completion involved a coalition of
            stakeholders: the United States government, the U.S. Army Corps of
            Engineers, contractor teams, thousands of laborers from multiple
            countries, and health authorities led by William C. Gorgas. Key
            engineering leaders included John Frank Stevens (chief engineer
            during crucial planning phases) and Lieutenant Colonel (later Major
            General) George W. Goethals who directed construction to completion.

          <h3>What</h3>
          <p>
            The Panama Canal is a man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic
            and Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus of Panama, employing a system
            of locks and lakes (including Gatun Lake) to lift ships above sea
            level and then lower them again. The Canal replaced the need for the
            long and dangerous Cape Horn route and reshaped global shipping
            routes, dramatically cutting journey times and costs for maritime
            commerce.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>When</h3>
          <p>
            Initial construction attempts by a French company led by Ferdinand
            de Lesseps began in the 1880s but failed by the late 19th century.
            The successful U.S.-led effort began shortly after the U.S. acquired
            the rights in 1904 and culminated with the Canal’s official opening
            on August 15, 1914. The decisive years for engineering,
            construction, and public health interventions were roughly
            1904–1914.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Where</h3>
          <p>
            The Canal crosses the Isthmus of Panama in Central America. Key
            construction sites included the Atlantic entrance near Colón, the
            Pacific entrance near Balboa (Panama City), the artificial Gatun
            Lake, the Culebra (Gaillard) Cut through the continental divide, and
            the locks at Gatun, Pedro Miguel, and Miraflores.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How (technical summary)</h3>
          <p>
            Rather than attempting a sea-level canal, engineers adopted a
            lock-based design that raised ships into an artificial lake (Gatun
            Lake) and used locks to manage elevation changes. Heavy excavation
            (rock and earth), dam construction, extensive dredging, and the
            building of massive lock chambers and gates required coordination
            between civil, mechanical, hydraulic, geotechnical, and materials
            engineering. Innovations included large-scale steam shovels and rail
            systems for spoil removal, modern concrete designs for the locks and
            dams, and major improvements in sanitation and disease control to
            enable year-round labor productivity.

        <section>
          <h3>Why (root cause of success)</h3>
          <p>
            The root causes of the Canal's success came from harmonizing
            technical redesign (switching from sea-level to locks), decisive
            leadership that employed disciplined project management, an
            aggressive public health campaign that drastically reduced malaria
            and yellow fever, and improved logistics and financing under U.S.
            stewardship. These factors together transformed a project that had
            failed under earlier efforts into a completed, enduring global
            infrastructure asset.
